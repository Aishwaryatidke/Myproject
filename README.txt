   In this project, I have three programs namely switchmain.c , stringh.h , strfun2.c which include main program to run the functions , implemented function prototypes and fuunction implementation respectively.
    In switchmain.c takes input from the text file data.txt. and in the file strfun2.c , I have implemented the functions as follows :         

1.strlen1() - counts the the length of the given string
2.strcpy1() - copies the string
3.strncpy1() - copies the string upto given 'n' length
4.stpcpy1() -  copy a string
5.strcat1() - concatenate two strings
6.strncat() - concatenate two strings upto n length
7.srerev1() - reverse a string
8.strcmp1() - compare two strings
9.strncmp1() - compare two string upto n length
10.strchr1() - return the pointer from the first occurance of the given character
11.strrchr1() -  return the pointer from the last occurance of the given character
12.strfreq() - count the frequency of the given character in the string
13.strascii() - return the ascii value of the character
14.strlwr1() - converts the string into lowercase
15.strupr1() - converts the string into uppercase
 
That's all..
